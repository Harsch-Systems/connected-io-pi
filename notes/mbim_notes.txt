It is possible to configure the Connected IO EMU Modem EM1000T-VZ-CAT1
to run in MBIM mode.  This eliminates the need to run AT commands to setup
the network connection.  Instead, we can use mbimcli(1) and mbim-network(1)
utilities to talk MBIM protocol to the modem for us. The example below also
uses a helper script mbim-set-ip that was downloaded from a blog (see inline
comments at the top of the script).

The steps to configure the modem in mbim mode and establish an ip link are
described below.  This example assumes a static IP configuration using the
Verizon APN 'we01.vzwstatic'

1.) Put the modem into MBIM mode by sending the following AT command (e.g.
minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0)
AT#USBCFG=5

Now power-cycle the modem and reboot the pi.  Confirm that the following
device is present after reboot:
/dev/cdc-wdm0

2.) Raspberry Pi OS already has the required drivers included (cdc_ncm, cdc_mbim)
Install the userland utilities:
	sudo apt install libmbim-utils

3.) Create the file /etc/mbim-network.conf with the contents:
APN=we01.vzwstatic
APN_USER=
APN_PASS=
APN_AUTH=
PROXY=yes

4.) Tell the modem to connect, using the command:
	sudo mbim-network /dev/cdc-wdm0 start

5.) Run the helper script to set the host IP, etc:
	sudo ./mbim-set-ip /dev/cdc-wdm0 wwan0

At this point, the modem should be connected and traffic should flow over the wwan0 interface
